Welcome to my corner of the internet.

This site is a digital front porch—minimal, animated, and alive—designed to capture what I'm about right now, and the kind of people I want to meet.

## 🧠 About Me

I’m **Mayank Singamreddy** — builder, artist, mystic.

- **Work**: Currently shaping AI data products at **Meta**. Previously at **Apple**, handling GenAI and ML infrastructure.
- **Projects**:  
  - 🎨 [**TheColorsOfAnime**](https://thecolorsofanime.com) — visual mood maps from anime.  
  - 📱 [**CheerSphere**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheersphere/id6503993239) — an app for ambient joy, live on the App Store.
- **Mission**: I’m searching for collaborators, co-founders, and kindred minds who care about meaning, not just momentum.
- **Interests**: indie tech, visual storytelling, mysticism, embodied cognition, ambient software, and building things people *feel*.

> Check out the [**Collab**](https://singamreddy.com/Collab) tab for ideas I'm excited to work on.

## 🧩 Site Stack (for the curious)

This site is hand-crafted with ✨ care:

- **HTML + CSS only**: No frameworks, just clean and minimal code.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with fluid font sizing across breakpoints.
- **Animations**:
  - Smooth `fadeIn` on load
  - Dynamic hover-based name animation with brand-style coloring
  - Subtle floating text rhythm
  - Circular profile image slider with clip-path transitions
- **Interaction**:
  - Hover-based animations
  - Click-to-copy email field with notification toast

It’s small, fast, and expressive—just like the things I like to build.
